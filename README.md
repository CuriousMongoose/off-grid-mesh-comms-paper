# Off grid mesh communications research

This research covers decentralized mesh communications that is suitable for use in off grid scenarios where no existing infrastructure is available. A number of commercial products and open source products exist in this space already. The goal of this research is to investigate the existing solutions, projects and technologies for use in off-grid mesh network communications.

*This is intended as a living paper. Contributions are encouraged, especially if you have experience in the field*

## Motivation

In December 2018, while on family holiday in Namibia my mother went for for what was supposed to be a 5km trail run in a rough desert mountain range early one morning. It was supposed to take less than an hour, yet after 2 hours she had not returned. Fearing that she possibly got lost and injured we mounted a search, which was seriously hampered by the lack of proper communication. There was no cell service in the area and we were stuck trying to use department store "walkie talkies", which became useless the moment there was a hill separating two people. Which is serious issue when the entire area consists only of steep hills and valleys.

My mother ended up reappearing 4 hours later, unhurt, having accidentally ended up on a longer 20km route. But the experience remained with me and I started brainstorming some possible low cost solutions for communications in similar scenarios, especially for non line of sight. Normal two way radio repeaters can be expensive or complicated to setup in these ad-hoc situations. Satellite comms is a good option but not exactly cheap. Having played with LORA and other RF modules that work in the license free band, I figured this could work well when interfaced with a smartphone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. After a some google searches I came across a number of commercial products and open source products that do exactly that.

## Scope

This research focuses on technology with the following requirements:

- Does not rely on existing infrastructure (cell networks/ satellite / permanent repeaters)
- Works in the license free (ISM) bands
- Can be deployed on a ad-hoc basis
- Makes use of mesh networking
- Can send text as a minimum
- Does not need mains power
